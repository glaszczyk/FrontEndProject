# Front-End project

##Technologies used:
* HTML5,
* CSS3,
* Sass,
* Gulp,
* Flexbox

###Naming
I used BEM notation and most important blocks are placed in separate files (in sass/layout folder). Usually blocks are without width property and size is defined for parent element.
I.e. .single-question__title-bar  has width set to 594px and it contains .title-bar block without width. 
This way, .title-bar is flexible and depends on .single-question__title-bar width only.

##Graphic
I used ionic font for some icons. I created some graphic (medal, pattern) as SVG files.
